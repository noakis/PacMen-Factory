DESCRIPTION

Using JavaScript with on click event, a PacMan image is created at a random location within the browser window.  A new Pacman will continue to randomly get created with each 'Add Pacman' and all will move at their own pace.

How to run:

. Clone the repository into your local environment
. Open the index.html file
. Right click and select 'Open Default browser' to open the project in your default browser
. Click 'Add PacMan'button to generate a PacMan on the page
. Click 'Start Game' button to make PacMen move on the screen

Roadmap of future improvements:

A stop button could be added to stop the game. Many other changes could be implemented like changing speed of the PacMen and also having them turn around.
